# Machine Learning Models from Scratch
This project aims to implement various machine learning models from scratch without using any built-in packages. The goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms and concepts by implementing them directly.

# Introduction
Machine learning has become a popular field with the availability of powerful libraries and frameworks. However, many of these libraries abstract away the details of the underlying algorithms, making it difficult for newcomers to fully understand how they work.

This project aims to bridge that gap by implementing common machine learning models from scratch. By doing so, we hope to provide a hands-on learning experience that covers the core concepts and algorithms used in machine learning.

# Usage
To use the implemented models, you can import the relevant Python files into your own projects. Each model is implemented as a separate file and follows a similar structure for consistency. The usage details can be found within the individual model files as code comments.

# Models Implemented
The following machine learning models have been implemented from scratch in this project:

1.Linear Regression

2.Logistic Regression

3.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

4.K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

5.Decision Trees Regression

6.Decision Trees Classification

7.Random Forests Regression

8.Random Forests Classification

9.XG Booster Regression

10.XG Booster Classification

Each model is implemented using basic Python and NumPy operations without relying on external libraries.
